<p>For a limited time, starbucks is bringing sulawesi single origin to starbucks® stores in the u.s. Bring the spirit of the season home with our jubilant starbucks holiday blend. Because starbucks beans are pure arabica coffee beans, they tend to taste better as the increase in sugar enhances the coffee’s taste, cleaner mouthfeel, and a decrease in bitterness. 1 star for the drink. Pick up one of our rare coffees today to experience new flavors.</p>
