<p>All you need is a whisk, a hand mixer or milk frother, instant coffee, sugar, water, and milk (or coffee creamer) — one tiktok user even purchased this kitchenaid hand mixer just to make it. And the ending results are still just as frothy and tasty. A lot of dalgona coffee videos on tiktok show people using a whisk to whip the ingredients together. Once you�re done chilling the dough and baking them in the oven at 325 degrees for 11 to 12 minutes, you�ll likely want to take. Brb, trying the pizza hack.</p>

<p>This tiktok from @kaseybarnharat isn�t exactly a recipe, but it�s a good reminder that you can�t go wrong topping pretzels with chocolate and m&amp;ms. If you want to try experiment with those as well, definitely try that the chocolate one is really tasty. In fact, tiktok users have even taken things a step further. Either hand whisk or use an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy and light. Scoop the frothy coffee mixture into a glass with ice and the milk of your choice, stir it up and serve.</p>
