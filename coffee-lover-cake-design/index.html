<p>5 out of 5 stars (94) 94 reviews Just starting off with filter coffee, ueckermann serves small volume batch brew made with a fetco in order to let everyone try filter coffee for a starting price of 1.50 euros per cup. Say adieu to your old coffee maker and say bonjour to one of the most ingenious contraptions ever created to give you an authentic french press coffee.the bodumchambard coffee and tea maker is a french press coffee maker that is constructed of a wonderful combination of borosilicate glass and stainless steel. You can smell the aroma of coffee as it bakes, and when you bite into it, you will not be disappointed because it tastes of coffee, and butter. The delicate design and white matte finish create a luxury touch making it a perfect gift for any coffee lover.</p>
