<p>Look for an unfinished dresser you can paint to match the rest of your space and add a simple mounted shelf to create a coffee bar with all of the essentials. It’s a good idea to set up the coffee in a place that’s away from heavy traffic. Use a wire basket to keep coffee and utensils organized. Decorating a home coffee bar requires a deft touch. Most guests are usually family so i know what they like, such as chocolate and their sweetener preference.</p>
