<p>Pour the mixture of water and vinegar into the water well, turn on the coffee maker, and let it brew. A ring around your coffee or tea pot is no way to greet your guests. Fill the water chamber of the coffee pot with equal parts water and plain white distilled vinegar. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. If you use dishwasher powder instead, place a quarter of a cup in the coffee pot.</p>
