Opening a coffee shop isn’t easy, but a detailed coffee shop equipment list can set you up for success. It’s based on what coffee you purchase. Having customers order and pay up front and calling them when their drinks and snacks are ready minimizes your labor costs and enables you to better handle busy periods such as breakfast and lunch. Despite 2020 being an absolute dumpster fire, it’s actually still a great time to enter the coffee business.</p>
