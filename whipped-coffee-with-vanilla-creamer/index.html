<p>Buttercream is no longer just for the top of your cupcake. Add 1 part lemon juice, 4 parts cold water and 16 parts powdered creamer to the mixing bowl. Either hand whisk or use an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy and light. I added the extra sugar since i omitted the coffee creamer. We�ve whipped up this natural buttercream flavor to serve as the perfect sweet and buttery pairing to your cup of coffee.</p>

<p>1 cup freshly brewed coffee. You’ll notice a difference when you use coffee creamer and heavy whipping cream without the carrageenan. Whip the mixture with the electric mixer on high for 1 to 2 minutes or until the mixture begins to stiffen and soft peaks begin to appear. Whip with an electric hand mixer or immersion blender for about 5 to 7 minutes or until the mixture is completely fluffy and has lightened in color. Since this coffee creamer is homemade and has no artificial ingredients or preservatives, it lasts the same amount of time as cream would in your fridge.</p>
