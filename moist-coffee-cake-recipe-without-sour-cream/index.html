<p>Add the dry ingredients to the cream mixture. Easy sour cream coffee cake made with an old fashioned recipe from my grandma. The perfect pairing to a hot cup of coffee. Would you like any spice in the recipe? If you need to, you can omit it completely, but note the cake will not be nearly as moist.</p>

<p>Beat just till smooth as overbeating tends to toughen dough. Last updated nov 26, 2020. Add the vanilla, eggs, and sour cream. My family loved this cake. Healthy sour cream coffee cake is the perfect crumbly cake for breakfast with whole wheat and oat flour that stays super moist with sour cream and applesauce.</p>
