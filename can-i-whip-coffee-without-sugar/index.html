<p>Which instant coffee is best to use? Now you can have your coffee and eat it too! Next, add your favorite milk — it can be dairy, soy, almond or milk. The basic recipe is simple: To begin, add your instant coffee, sugar, and water to a mixing bowl and whisk using a hand whisk, electric hand mixer, or a stand mixer.</p>

<p>Either hand whisk or use an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy and light. Or some people go heavy on artificial sweeteners and syrups. (you can use up to 2 tablespoons sugar for a sweeter.

<p>Powdered sugar also helps homemade whipped cream hold its shape, because it has a small amount of cornstarch in it, which is a natural whipped cream stabilizer. I have not found this to be necessary, but you can certainly do it this way if you want! I finally tried it and it is definitely a “nailed it” recipe! Dalgona coffee, or “creamy coffee” has gone viral as a favorite quarantine drink! Sugar free whipped coffee iced latte.</p>
