<p>The opposite is actually true. When a recipe calls for cream without specifying what type, it is best to use heavy cream; Over medium heat, whisk until the mixture turns clear.

<p>It’s surprisingly easy to make and only takes a few short minutes and three ingredients, heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Get one of our horseradish sauce substituting substituting whipped cream for half and half recipe and prepare delicious and healthy treat for your family or friends. I have a half gallon of half and half in my fridge and would like to make some whipped cream with it, i know that i need whipping cream to do this but i was wondering if there is anything i could add to half and half to create a whipped cream? Into the powdered sugar before adding to mixing bowl. This substitute works in virtually any recipe.</p>
