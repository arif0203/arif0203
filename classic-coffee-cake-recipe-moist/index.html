<p>Complete with a buttery crumb streusel and cinnamon sugar swirl, this coffee cake is a serious crowd pleaser! The aroma when this is baking is really out of this world! 225g (2 sticks) butter, at room temperature (if using unsalted, add 1/4 tsp salt) 225g (1 cup) caster sugar The fewer surfaces are exposed to air, the better, so cut only what you need. You may find slight variations of the cake at different starbucks locations.</p>
