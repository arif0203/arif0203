<p>Good, if you don�t actually like the taste of coffee. Tea lovers have also taken to tik tok, whipping up matcha the same way they do coffee. To kick things off, start out by combining one teaspoon of instant coffee with one teaspoon of sugar, as well as one teaspoon of water in a mug. The dalgona coffee recipe calls for a ratio of 1:1:1 instant coffee powder, sugar and hot water. This recipe is for frothy coffee at home.</p>
