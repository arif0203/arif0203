<p>I like nescafe instant coffee but you can use whatever instant coffee you’d like. With almost 10 million views on her whipped coffee video, user @imhannahcho seems to have popularized the trend on the app. For this recipe, we used a simple hand whisk, and it worked great. The best part of this diy coffee drink is that you only need 3 ingredients to make this dalgona recipe. And, more generally, there are versions.</p>

<p>Although it is known to most as a south korean beverage, whipped coffee or beaten coffee actually has its origin in pakistan/india (called phitti hui normally served hot) and macau. Dalgona coffee, more commonly known as whipped coffee, has become one of the biggest trends on the internet over the past month. This is another great way to enjoy your morning coffee. Either hand whisk or use an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy and light. The best part of this diy coffee drink is that you only need 3 ingredients to make this dalgona recipe.</p>

<p>Also know as dalgona coffee, this coffee drink has a frothy layer on the top with chilled milk below it. The name dalgona comes from a korean sponge candy that resembles honeycomb. Takes only 5 minutes to make and it’s so fluffy and delicious! In greece, the frappé is dalgona’s older, frothier sibling. In india and pakistan, whipped coffee has long been a popular home brew, known as phenti hui.</p>
