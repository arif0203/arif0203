<p>You can use melted butter instead of the oil, if desired. Hi there, i am mrs p, thanks for coming to my kitchen. A few coffees, a hot chocolate, and a few (more) more muffins later, we decided we were going to replicate the recipe at home. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry and mix only to moisten. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</p>

<p>Today’s recipe for coffee and walnut cake is based on my mum’s recipe that she used to make for sunday tea, but i’ve increased the quantities to make a large cake. A spoon just won’t do the job here. 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (270 g) whole milk. It’s going to seem like a lot of crumb topping but it’s just enough. If you are not familiar with coffee cake (cake frequently served with coffee for breakfast or dessert), i would suggest reading almost any baking cookbook.</p>
