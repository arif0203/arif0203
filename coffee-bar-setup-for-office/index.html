<p>Have a designated station with supplies all in 1 place. Look for an unfinished dresser you can paint to match the rest of your space and add a simple mounted shelf to create a coffee bar with all of the essentials. Once your bar is ready to go, get inspired with these copycat coffee shop drinks. Set yourself up for a relaxing weekend by placing your coffee bar in the coziest spot in your kitchen. Possibly kitchen canisters for coffee, etc, and baskets or boxes for.</p>

<p>The kitchen might seem like a logical choice, but setting up your coffee bar in the kitchen will reduce how much counter space you have. Instead of driving 15 minutes out of your way to meet at a coffee shop, meet at your own office coffee bar! More importantly, your coffee bar should be located somewhere where guests will see it and you can use it, but also where it won’t be in the way. A vintage look is added here with newspaper print. Make a cup of coffee using your coffee station to see how easy and convenient it is.</p>

<p>Instead of driving 15 minutes out of your way to meet at a coffee shop, meet at your own office coffee bar! Kind of dumb, since i’ll have to spend money to set up a coffee bar! While some people enjoy drinking black coffee, others will want to add creamer and sugar. Pass by any busy specialty coffee shop and it will likely be full of customers enjoying coffee, espresso, lattes, teas, and a variety of pastries and other goodies. Possibly kitchen canisters for coffee, etc, and baskets or boxes for.</p>
