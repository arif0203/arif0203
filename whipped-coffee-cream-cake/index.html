<p>Here are the ingredients for coffee mate, we will use this as an example. It is milder in taste, for those who like mild coffee. It sure did to me, which is why i whipped up this delicious lemon cream cheese coffee cake with a sweet crumb topping! While my cake may have changed, my whipped cream is still the same i made in my grandma’s kitchen as a kid. Add in the flour, baking powder, and salt until well blended.</p>

<p>The topping was to die for and so easy. When i made dalgona coffee.the first thing which came into my mind is using it as frosting. She has found a way to totally engage her reader and make them feel like they are right there with her. That year was worth the wait. Hello everyone, how was your 4th of july weekend?</p>
