<p>Below are some variations of dalgona coffee or tea you can also whip up. I tested the recipe with both sugar, monk fruit, swerve, and honey. You can make dalgona coffee without sugar, but the whipped and fluffy nature of the coffee doesn’t stay the same for as long of. 1.5 tbsp instant coffee, 1.5 tbsp hot water, and only 1 tsp of sugar. Yes, you can make a whipped coffee without the sugar but let me tell you that the unsweetened version of this coffee does not taste very as good, it turns out to be quite strong and bitter in taste.</p>

<p>Jessica notes that while you can make the whip without sugar, using sugar allows it to stay whipped and fluffy for much longer. In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, add the instant coffee, sugar, and hot water. Dalgona coffee, also known as whipped coffee has crazily taken off like wild fire on social media platforms (such as tik tok and ig), and rightfully so. Even though the texture of the whipped topping remains to be the same, but it goes away quickly in 5 minutes without the addition of sugar to the. Next, add your favorite milk — it can be dairy, soy, almond or milk.</p>
