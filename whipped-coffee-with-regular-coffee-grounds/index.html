<p>For example, use 4 tbs of hot water to 4 tbs of instant coffee granules. The way caffeine works is that is needs to be extracted from your actual coffee bean or ground. Dalgona coffee is a popular korean coffee known as whipped coffee made with just 3 ingredients. For me, i don’t like that intensity. Though the recipe calls for instant coffee, there are simple substitutes if you don�t.</p>
