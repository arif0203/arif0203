<p>Evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk are canned milk products that can be somewhat confusing. This is done commonly for different reasons, such as creating a kosher thanksgiving spread. Because both evaporated and condensed milk have a long shelf life they can stored, ready for whenever you want it, or even brought along on a camping trip for a special treat coffee. Milk in your coffee does help with acid reflux and remember that black coffee has high ph levels so is acidic. Sweetened condensed milk is cow�s milk ,the water content has been evaporated an sugar has been added ;</p>

<p>Condensed milk is referred to as both condensed milk and sweetened condensed milk; Many creamers are also dairy free. Add a dash of angostura. But because evaporated milk is creamier and thicker than regular milk or coffee creamer, you probably need less of it. The texture of liquid creamer is much thinner than sweetened condensed milk and they do not have the heating and thickening qualities of sweetened condensed milk.</p>
