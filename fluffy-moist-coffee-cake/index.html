I followed my usual buttercream sort of recipes, and added in the dissolved coffee to get the perfect fluffy thickness and heavenly frosting to match such a delicious cake. Whisk, then cover and set aside until ready to ice the cake. The fragrance of coffee in a moist, light and fluffy cake is one that’s bound to get you baking. Don�t over mix the cake mixture!</p>
