To kick things off, start out by combining one teaspoon of instant coffee with one teaspoon of sugar, as well as one teaspoon of water in a mug. The recipe only requires instant coffee, sugar, hot water, and milk — items most people already have in their pantry. Using a hand mixer, beat the mixture for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the color changes to a golden brown and the mixture takes on a thick consistency.</p>

<p>This is a type of korean coffee known as dalgona coffee. (you can use up to 2 tablespoons sugar for a sweeter. Like i mentioned above, you can do this by hand but you will be whisking for a long time. Tea lovers have also taken to tik tok, whipping up matcha the same way they do coffee. It’s one of those recipes that is so easy to make, but looks really fancy.it’s a coffee shop type of coffee drink we can enjoy at home!</p>

<p>This whipped coffee recipe is all the rage these last couple weeks. The trend was first popularized in south korea, spreading across the world as more countries started recommending that people engage in social distancing. Instant coffee�s moment in the limelight started back in january, when a south korean tv host tried the whipped coffee recipe, nicknamed it dalgona (a type of korean honeycomb candy) and sent it. In the video, she dumps equal parts instant coffee, sugar and hot water. I have shared a beaten coffee recipe on my blog few years back.</p>
