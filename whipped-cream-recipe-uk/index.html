<p>If the mixture has separated a bit, gently stir it back together with a spoon. The vanilla pudding mix adds a nice flavor! 5 mins makes 4 cups (56 tbsp ) show me for cups. Use whipped cream as desired. To make it diplomat cream, you fold whipped cream into the pastry cream and it is a new thing entirely.</p>

<p>Place the sugar into the mixing bowl and add the whipping cream. With just three ingredients, this recipe can be made in minutes.nothing beats its light, sweet, chocolaty flavor. Theres a high chance u can over whip ur cream if u whip it first then mixing it with the buttercream. Now you can have your coffee and eat it too! Using this recipe to stabilise the whipped cream gives a buttercream texture and can be piped and used as regular buttercream can, however tasting more like whipped cream etc.</p>
