<p>With only 3 ingredients plus milk of your choice and 5 minutes with a hand mixer you will be enjoying whipped dalgona coffee recipe!not only is it super tasty, but it is such a beautiful drink to make too! Boiling water in a cup or whatever. I made it exactly as the recipe was written but there are so many possibilities, i’m sure we’ll make this a lot in the future with many different twists!. It can garnish by adding cocoa or coffee powder or small chocolate chips as a topping. The combination of cold milk and the bittersweet coffee is absolutely delicious.</p>
