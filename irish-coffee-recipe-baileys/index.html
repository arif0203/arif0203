<p>We went straight to baileys to get their official recipe for baileys and coffee. To make the bailey’s creamer all you need to do is gently heat a can of condensed milk with milk or cream. An irish coffee was the inspiration for this fabulous adult only irish coffee cake with baileys cream. Irish coffee with bailey�s and kahlua. Make up a glass or mug of 150ml black coffee.</p>
