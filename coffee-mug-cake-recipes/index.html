<p>For plain coffee cake, just swap out the pumpkin puree. Add all remaining cake ingredients except sprinkles; Want more coffee mug cake recipes? I thiink the best part of this coffee mug cake is the fact that i won’t be tempted by having a whole coffee cake sitting on the counter, calling my name. So i decided to cut the recipe in half… well sometimes we make decisions and don’t act on them fully.</p>
