<p>That’s roughly a 1 : That is a biiiig difference. According to food52, the optimal cold brew coffee ratio is 3/4 cup coarsely ground coffee to every four cups of cold water. Finally, cold brew will clear caffeine much slower, therefore you’ll get a much longer “hit”, so to speak in that manner, for some people, cold brew may be a bit more effective boost than regular coffee. A standard cold brew to water ratio (using starbucks cold brew as my standard) is 8oz water to 1oz coffee grounds.this equates to 1 cup of water to ~⅓ cup coarsely ground coffee.*.</p>

<p>This recipe is scaled down to be more appropriate for home use. The cold brew ratio is extremely important. To obtain cold brew concentrate, you need to mix ground coffee and cold water in a 1:4 or 1:5 ratio, leave for 24 hours, and filter. In 4oz of liquid of cold brew concentrate, you’ll have around 250mg of caffeine (most likely more). If you have a smaller french press, just use less coffee and water, while maintaining the same ratio (for example:</p>

<p>I use 55 grams for 700ml of water. For a cold brew concentrate a good coffee to water ratio to begin with, is 1:4 (1g of coffee for every 4g of water). Then follow with the pitted dates and blend until mixed in thoroughly. If you love strong coffee, you can make your cold brew using a 1:1 ratio of the concentrate to water/milk. Either way, you�ll want to dilute this about 1:1.</p>
