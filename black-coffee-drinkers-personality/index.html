<p>So i’ve decided to consult the experts: Ramani durvasula recently conducted an observational study of 1,000 coffee drinkers. A recent study examined one thousand coffee drinkers and associated personality traits and types with their coffee preferences. The type of coffee you order may reveal more about your personality than you think. S ure, almost everybody likes coffee, but apparently how you like your coffee can reveal quite a bit about your personality.</p>

<p>A study says people who prefer black coffee might have psychopathic traits. They determined that tastes for bitter foods, such as black coffee, beer. And then i realized that i do actually associate different personality types with black coffee and coffee with milk. As it turns out, black coffee drinkers are the most likely to consider themselves as light sleepers. Ramani durvasula recently conducted an observational study of 1,000 coffee drinkers.</p>
