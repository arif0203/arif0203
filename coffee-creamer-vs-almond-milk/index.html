<p>Homemade almond milk coffee creamer keeps refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a week. Over my coffee drinking years, i’ve experimented with different coffee creamers. We explored total calories, fat content, saturated fat content, grams of protein, and levels of sugar, then put all of our findings in a handy chart. Pour the almond milk into the bag and gently squeeze to release the almond milk. Calfia farms pecan caramel almond milk creamer.</p>

<p>Chocolate milk vs regular milk. If you ask me, then i would certainly recommend you to use coconut milk instead of coffee creamer in your coffee. Boy, oh boy, am i ecstatic to have found this!. But even with that being said, health experts do not recommend using whole milk when taking coffee due to its somewhat high carbs count and allergenic potential. The process of making almond milk is similar to that of brewing coffee.</p>
