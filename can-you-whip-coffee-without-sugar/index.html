<p>I finally tried it and it is definitely a “nailed it” recipe! Jessica notes that while you can make the whip without sugar, using sugar. I can try just whipping water and coffee in the morning. You can substitute instant coffee for the brewed espresso. While we love the original recipe (and resulting sugar rush), we can’t help but wonder what other flavor combinations are possible.</p>

<p>Of course, this amount of sugar is totally fine as a treat, but i wanted to see if it was possible to reduce the sugar and still have the whipped coffee turn out.

It’s best to stir the whipped coffee into the almond milk to really get it absorbed well.</p>

<p>If you’re making beaten coffee for a crowd, make a ton of the whipped coffee concentrate and then dole it out into mugs before adding milk. Jessica notes that while you can make the whip without sugar, using sugar. Salt and brown sugar are fine though. There are numerous ways you can reduce your intake of added sugar even further. (you can use up to 2 tablespoons sugar for a sweeter.</p>
