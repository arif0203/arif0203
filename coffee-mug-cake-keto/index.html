<p>A mug cake that satisfies every coffee cake lover. When it was done i sprinkled brown sugar truvia on top and it melted in a bit then i spread a bit of cream cheese frosting i made with cream cheese and a splash of hwc and a tiny bit of swerve. They are quick to prepare and it keeps you from eating large portions of desserts, so try my keto coffee mug cake. Track exercise, weight, ketones, blood glucose, and body measurements.
