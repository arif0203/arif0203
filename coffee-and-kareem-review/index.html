The problematic history of black men and white cops. Loath as i am to punch down at a mere child, coffee &amp; kareem has me in a tight spot. Nothing really, except everything is stupefyingly wrong with coffee and kareem, a doa, dysfunctional family farce with an overeager cast — led by ed helms, taraji p.</p>
