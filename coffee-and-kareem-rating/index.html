<p>While police officer james coffee (ed helms) enjoys his new relationship with vanessa manning (taraji p. Coffee &amp; kareem seemed funny to me when i played the netflix trailer of it. Coffee &amp; kareem takes this strategy to a chaotic extreme. The reason you watch a movie like coffee &amp; kareem is for a few laughs, and on that front, the film mostly delivers, though as with cop and a half, it�ll likely play better the younger you are. I feel so bad for terrence little gardenhigh, who plays kareem.</p>

Starring ed helms, terrence little gardenhigh, betty gilpin, ronreaco lee, andrew bachelor, david alan grier, and taraji p. But when pen hits paper, the writing here is tired and juvenile.</p>
