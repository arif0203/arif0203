<p>Making great espresso is difficult. What’s more, since every coffee is different, the best ratio will vary according to the origin, roast profile, and more. That means you need 17 grams of water for 1 gram of coffee. Ahh yes, the golden ratio. The ideal water temperature at the grouphead of the espresso machine should be between 195 °f / 91 °c to 203 °f / 95 °c, with a target temperature for most coffees of 200 °f / 93 °c.brew ratio, coffee roast level, coffee varietal, and processing all can have an effect on the optimal brew temperature.</p>

<p>Our understanding and processes surrounding coffee have changed over the years. So in many standard machines you may use 18 grams of coffee for an output of 36. For 20 grams of ground beans in, you want to get about 30 grams of liquid espresso out. That means you need 17 grams of water for 1 gram of coffee. Remember, the perfect espresso needs a pressure of at least 9 to 15 bars and a very fine grind.</p>

<p>Hendon discovered that when extracting the espresso, water needs to come in contact with the grounds equally. Especially if you’re leaving the world of keurig (bless your soul) or trying to cut back o This relationship is usually expressed in a dose:yield fashion, so a ratio of 1:2 means that for every gram of dry coffee, we will extract two grams of espresso. Many people would consider 1:2/50% a standard espresso. Perfecting your espresso will also lead to the other drinks getting better.</p>
