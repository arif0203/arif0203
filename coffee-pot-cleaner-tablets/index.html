<p>Run the coffee machine using the brewing mode. Put a few squirts of dishwashing detergent into the water and use a scrubby brush to scrub away any of the coffee and hard water stains. They come in a variety of formats, including powders, dissolvable tablets, and liquid decalcifiers. Take care of coffee pot stain removal with ease with vinegar and baking soda. Once they’ve fully dissolved, put the parts in and let them sit until much of the residue is gone.</p>

<p>Cleaning your coffee pot with commercial descaler is almost exactly the same—simply substitute the vinegar for the descaling solution, adding the amount instructed on the packaging. Only logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review. This powerful combination makes a great coffee pot descaling solution to get rid of mineral buildup and debris that often accumulate on the interior of the machine. By running a brew cycle with a tabz tablet in the basket users can simultaneously clean both the brew basket and server beneath. Z61 and z95 versions do not contain phosphates.</p>
