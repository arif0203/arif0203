<p>Coffee is a commonly consumed beverage because of its caffeine content, which has many different effects on the human body and can impact blood glucose levels 1.however, coffee appears to have different effects on blood glucose in the long term than in the short term, so more research needs to be done to determine the exact relationship between coffee and blood glucose. This is one of the rare surface epithelial tumor of ovary. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data confirmed the species as colletotrichum gloeosporioides.the pathogenicity of the isolate was also confirmed by detached leaf method which inoculated the virulent isolate into coffee leaves. The anthracnose pathogen was isolated from coffee leave and bean symptoms. Images hosted on other servers: Invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas is the most common type of pancreatic cancer.</p>
