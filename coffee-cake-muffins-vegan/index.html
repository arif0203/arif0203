<p>One of the first things i ever baked growing up, was the coffee cake recipe from the back of the bisquick box. Preheat the oven to 350 f. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. In a small bowl add the flour, pecans, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. I’m so excited to share with you my new recipe for gluten free coffee cake muffins.</p>

<p>These coffee cake muffins are so tender thanks to buttermilk, so buttery thanks to butter, and are so warm and cozy, thanks to a dash of cinnamon. One for the muffins, one for the crumb topping and one for the glaze. Coffee cake muffins (gf, v, df) these coffee cake muffins are not only buttery and delicious they are gluten free and vegan. They are great for breakfast, brunch, snack or dessert. We prefer soy milk) all purpose flour;</p>
