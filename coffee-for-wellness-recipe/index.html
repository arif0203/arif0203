<p>Mike and i love to travel and take trips together. Though they’ve been around for several years, brands like four sigmatic, sun potion , and moon juice have exploded in the last year or two. Believe it or not, you can get a serving of fruit from your morning drink! Essentially instant coffee or tea fortified with adaptogenic mushrooms, four sigmatic drinks are instant coffee for the wellness generation. Recipe made from about 1½ cups of strong organic light roast coffee.</p>

<p>Easy sweet cream iced coffee recipe. Not only do the two flavors mix well, but the stimulating effects of caffeine can very nicely compliment the stoned effects of cannabis. You may want to use a drain catcher to collect grounds from going down the drain. Sweet iced coffee is blended with vanilla ice cream for a homemade version of a coffeehouse treat. The exact recipe can vary.</p>
