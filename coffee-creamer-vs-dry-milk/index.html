<p>Lately i have been wondering if there is a good milk substitute for coffee creamer. It also adds a little thickness to the coffee that replicates dairy creamers. There are about 140 calories in one ounce of whole dry milk and 103 calories in one ounce of nonfat dry milk. Instead of coffee creamer, you will add milk powder in your coffee. If the milk is a baking liquid, substitution is not an issue.</p>
