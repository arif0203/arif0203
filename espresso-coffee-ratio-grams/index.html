<p>Using traditional italian espresso nomenclature, we’ll refer to a brew ratio of 1:1 (18 grams in / 18 grams out, for example) to 1:2 (18 grams in / 36 grams out) as a “ristretto” espresso; For example, if you put 20g of ground coffee inside the portafilter and pull a 40g shot, you’ll have a brew ratio of 20:40 or 1:2. As our basket size is 18g we tend to start with this as our dose. A 1:2 to a 1:3 ratio as a “normale” espresso; Strength is determined by the ratio of coffee to water, increasing the amount of coffee increases the strength.</p>

<p>This means that if you were dosing 18 grams of dry coffee, you would end with 36 grams of liquid espresso in your cup. The standard cup in us measurement is 8 fl ounces, while a cup on your coffee maker is 5 fl ounces. So, if you use a typical dose of 20 grams of coffee in your pro 2 portafilter, fill the cylinder completely with brew water, and lower the lever all the way, you’ll yield roughly 60 grams of coffee, making a 1:3 ratio and a lungo shot. The most common brew ratio to start with is two times the dry coffee dose. For every 15 grams(ml) of water, you use 1 gram of coffee.</p>

<p>Using the 1:18 golden ratio, we get 83 grams of coffee for 10 cups. The clive recipe for espresso is the same as used by the originator of american espresso (and the pioneer of latte art), espresso vivacé in seattle. If you have 1 g of coffee and 15 g of water, the ratio would be 1:15. How many grams of coffee per cup? This ratio is often expressed like 1:13 where 1 is coffee and 13 is parts water.</p>

<p>Some are even as small as 1 tbsp. Some are even as small as 1 tbsp. There’s a short list of what we can really control in life. This relationship is usually expressed in a dose:yield fashion, so a ratio of 1:2 means that for every gram of dry coffee, we will extract two grams of espresso. The clive recipe for espresso is the same as used by the originator of american espresso (and the pioneer of latte art), espresso vivacé in seattle.</p>
