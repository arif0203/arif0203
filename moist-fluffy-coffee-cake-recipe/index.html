<p>Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Beat in the strong espresso or coffee, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the frosting is fluffy and spreadable. The aroma when this is baking is really out of this world! It tastes great and can be combined with any frosting. Add ½ cup mayo (yes, mayo!) to the batter when mixing.</p>

<p>Add ½ cup mayo (yes, mayo!) to the batter when mixing. The buttercreamed cake can also be frozen in the same way. Beat in the strong espresso or coffee, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the frosting is fluffy and spreadable. To freeze the coffee sponge cake, wait for it to cool and then wrap the cake in clingfilm or store it in an airtight container before freezing. Coffee brings out and amplifies the chocolate flavor in baked goods like cake and cupcakes.</p>
