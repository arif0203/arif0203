Don�t stay awake for too long / don�t go to bed / i�ll make a cup of coffee for your head / i�ll get you up and going out of bed / and i promise that one day i�ll feel fine / and i Pace the floor, stop and stare i drink a cup of coffee and start pulling out my hair i�m drinking forty cups of coffee forty cups of coffee forty. F e your loyalty is not me but to the stars above [chorus] f e one more cup of coffee for the road. So, one cup of coffee then i�ll go!</p>
