<p>Cool water in a small bowl. Iced coffee with coffee jelly ₱59: Enjoy these jollibee meals with the new iced coffee with coffee jelly or brown sugar milk tea with pearls. Mix 1½ tbsp instant coffee and sugar with gelatin before cooking. Pour into a blender with the milk along with 2 or 3 handfuls of ice and maple syrup, if using, then blend until smooth and foamy.</p>
