<p>All of it�s a great combination. This frosting holds its shape, lasts for days and can be used to frost both cake and cupcakes. This is the ultimate coffee buttercream recipe you will ever need. Frosting that are combined with whipped cream have a lighter, softer and fluffier texture. Mix the coffee powder with the water in a small bowl until dissolved.</p>

<p>One mail which i often get is, how to make frosting without butter or cream. Beat whipping cream, sugar, milk powder, vanilla, and coffee mixture together in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Instant coffee crystals, sugar, and ice water. Like the little bitter notes in the coffee are echoed in the chocolate and the sweetness of the chocolate. Mix the coffee powder with the water in a small bowl until dissolved.</p>
